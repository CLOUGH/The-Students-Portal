The-Student-Portal
==================
The student portal is a web based application that is an iterated version of the Online Student Advisory
Portal (OSAP).The system was built for the Object Technology course at the University of The West Indies
and is placed on github to collaborate with members of group. 

The Problem
===========
Students after being enrolled in a University or College have a very difficult time adjusting to the university
polices, making correct decisions and registering for courses. This problem normally set back students a year
or two in the institution, which in turn waste student time, money and may contribute to a student dropping out. 
The system normally in place require per to per communication which in most case is expensive and impractical due 
to the amount of students normally enrolled in these institution.
The problem can be addressed if there was a system that could assist students with the registration process, and 
giving academic advice to students so that they can achieve their career goals. The Student Portal is that system.
It will give student academic advice, registration tips and further assistance with a academic advisor if necessary.
