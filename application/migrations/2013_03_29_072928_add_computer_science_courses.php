							 skills within students of Computing. It is not aimed at teaching any particular 
							 programming language or paradigm per se. The ideas covered in this course will be 
							 revisited in more detail in a variety of courses in the subsequent part of the 
							 Information Technology/Computer Science major. As a consequence, no knowledge of 
							 programming is assumed as a prerequisite to this course, yet at the end of the course 
							 students would have been exposed in a concrete way to computation, and the tools that 
							 have been developed to control its complexity as well as implement its processes in 
							 physical devices. This course therefore serves as one of the cornerstone courses of 
							 the entire curriculum for the Information Technology programme and the Computer Science 
							 major, and requires only that students come to it prepared to think in ways unfamiliar 
							 to them.',

							as she experiments with proposed solutions to a problem. We hope that this mode of interaction
							will build confidence in students as they learn the joys and challenges of programming. This
							course continues the entry level course COMP1126. It covers concepts and tools that are

			'description'=>'COMP3900 is the group project course in the Computer Science curriculum. It is a required course for
							all students majoring in Computer Science. It is intended to be a capstone course that will bring
							together many of the topics that were covered in the rest of the curriculum. For this reason, we
							expect that students take this course in their final year, or at least after they have completed all
							of the core courses of the curriculum.

							In this course, students will identify a project they would like to work on, and be assigned to
							a supervisor who is able to provide guidance on the specific topic they have chosen. The scope of
							acceptable projects is wide open. Students are encouraged to approach this course with an open
							mind, and to be creative in coming up with their projects. In coming up with a project idea, you are
							encouraged to think about problems that need solving, rather than technologies that you know how
							to apply. Your supervisor will help you to scope your project appropriately, and to provide technical
							assistance with some aspects of your design and implementation. However, do not expect that your
							supervisor will know all of the answers to all of your questions. Learning specific details that are
							rarely known to other persons in the computing field is something you should learn to expect when
							you become fully immersed in a project; and you will find that it can be a tremendously satisfying
							experience. One way to view COMP3900 is as an opportunity to learn about a computing topic that
							was not covered to your satisfaction within the rest of the curriculum; you are encouraged to make
							the most of that opportunity.',
